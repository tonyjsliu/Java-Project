A postman is delivering mails in a square-shaped town. He starts from the start (S) and should arrive at the goal (G). On the way, he has to deliver mails at some checkpoints (X).One possible configuration of the town is like:#########...G.X##.##.X.##S.X...#########Calculate the minimum distance the postman has to travel from the start to the goal while passing all the checkpoints.Remarks:'S' = start point'G' = goal point'X' = checkpoint'.' = open-block that the postman can pass'#' = closed-block that the postman cannot pass- A movement means a vertical or horizontal step (up, down, left or right)- Other types of movements, such as moving diagonally, or skipping one or more blocks, are NOT allowed.- The postman cannot get out of the map.- Distance is defined as the number of movements- The postman CAN pass opened-blocks, checkpoints, the start, and the goal more than once if necessary.- You can assume 1<=width<=100, 1<=height<=100.- The maximum number of checkpoints is 18.- Return -1 if given arguments do not satisfy specifications, or players cannot arrive at the goal from the start by passing all the checkpoints.
